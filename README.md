# üóìÔ∏è Appointments
Example application to create appointments (REST API). Appointments are stored in a relational DB
(Postgres), and their creation/deletion is published to a Kafka broker.

## üìò Architecture
* [Hexagonal]/[Onion]/[Clean] Architecture
* OpenAPI code generation (server and client)

[Hexagonal]: https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture
[Onion]: https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1
[Clean]: https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html

## üß∞ Stack
* Java 21
* Spring 3.3 (configurable server, 'undertow' by default)
  * Actuator (healthcheck, etc.)
* Flyway (chosen over Liquibase for its simplicity)
* Postgres
* Kafka

## üèéÔ∏è Runtime
* Cloud Native Buildpacks (building)
* Docker Compose (local environment with the infrastructure)

## üß™ Test
* ArchUnit (preferred over Java modules: it allows naming checks, etc.)
* Testcontainers (used to provide a test instance of Postgres and Kafka)

## ‚öíÔ∏è Development
* SDKMAN (allows to use simpler runners on CI)
* Maven Wrapper (Maven can be provided by SDKMAN, however, Maven Wrapper has better IDE support)
* Editorconfig (supported by a lot of editors, rules limited though)
* CI pipelines for GitHub and GitLab

## üìë Requirements
* Docker Compose
* JDK 21+
* SDKMAN (optional, recommended)

## ü§î Design Decisions
* Simplicity and pragmatism over Hexagonal Architectures 'by the book'.
* Minimal: don't use libraries to implement easy stuff (even if that's boring).
* Start small, split and refactor when features are added (I.e.: split services into use cases).
* Prefer flat structure (avoid empty parent packages if possible).
* Small coupling with Spring (easier to migrate, to other frameworks/toolkits).
* Not use Spring integrations if a library can be used directly.
* No Spring profiles (settings are loaded from the environment).
* Split API spec in different files for future modularity.
* Prefer service independence over code reuse (sharing libraries among microservices).
* Docker Compose profiles are used to separate infrastructure from a complete local environment.
* Atomicity in notifiers (with outbox pattern) should be done with a different notifier adapter.
* No input ports: they don't need to be decoupled, they just use the domain (and that's acceptable).

## üìñ Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](doc/architecture.svg)
* **Port:** interface to set a boundary between application logic and implementation details.
* **Adapter:**: port implementation to connect the application domain with the system's context.
* **Domain:**: application logic and model entities.
* **Service:**: implement operations with a common topic altogether. Usually calls driven ports.
* **UseCase/Case:**: single operation service (isolate features). They can coexist with services.
* **Output/Driven Adapter:**: implementation of ports called from the domain.
* **Input/Driver Adapter:**: commands that call application logic (don't require a port).

## üìö Design
* The REST API controller and client are generated from the OpenAPI spec at build time.
* `domain` holds business logic (services and/or use cases) and driven ports (interfaces).
* `domain.model` keeps the structures relevant to the application's domain. The more logic added to
  an entity, the better (it could be easily accessed by many different services, or use cases).
* `output.{notifiers,repositories}` driven adapters (implementations of driven ports).
* `input.controllers` driver adapter (adapters without interface).
* Subpackages can be created for different adapter implementations (to isolate their code).
* More information about each package rules can be found on their Javadoc documentation.

## üéöÔ∏è Set up
* With SDKMAN: `sdk env install`
* If SDKMAN is not available, JDK 21+ must be installed.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Commands
All commands assume a Unix like OS.

The most important commands to operate the project are:

* Build: `./mvnw package`
* Documentation: `./mvnw site`
* Run: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
* Build image: `./mvnw verify` or `./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`

To run or deploy the application:

* Start infrastructure (for running locally): `docker-compose up -d`
* Run JAR locally: `java -jar target/appointments-0.1.0.jar`
* Run container: `docker-compose --profile local up`

## ü§ñ Service Management
* You can check the API spec using [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html).

### Docker
At the `docker-compose.yml` you can find the information on how to run the application as a
container, adjusting the configuration for running it on different environments.

Two Docker compose profiles are used:
- Default profile (no profile parameter): to allow starting only the infrastructure, this is useful
  to start the application from the IDE
- Local profile (--profile local): which also starts a container using the image of this application

### Testing
The verification requests can be executed with: `src/test/resources/requests.sh`, or
`PORT=9090 src/test/resources/requests.sh` if you want to run them to a different port.

The health check endpoint is: http://localhost:18080/actuator/health
